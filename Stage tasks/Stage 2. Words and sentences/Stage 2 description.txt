Description

However, a real text may be pretty long and still easy to read, right? There needs to be another approach. How about 
calculating the number of words in each sentence? Clearly, if each sentence of a text contains a lot of words, this text 
is hard to read.

Suppose that if the text contains sentences that on average have more than 10 words per sentence, this text is hard to read. 
Otherwise, this text is easy to read. Don't worry, we will consider more scientific ways in the next stages.

The input contains a single line of text. Output "HARD" if the text is hard to read and "EASY" if the text is easy to read.

For example, the first example contains two sentences with 6 and 10 words (numbers also count as words) so the average is 8, 
and this is less than 10. In the second example, there are also 2 sentences but with 6 and 16 words, so the average is 11 and 
this is more than 10. If the average is equal to 10, the text is still considered easy to read.

Don't forget that sentences can end with a full stop as well as with an exclamation mark and a question mark. But the last 
sentence can be with or without a punctuation mark at the end.

Examples:

Example 1

> This text is simple to read! It has on average less than 10 words per sentence.
EASY

Example 2

> This text is hard to read. It contains a lot of sentences as well as a lot of words in each sentence
HARD
