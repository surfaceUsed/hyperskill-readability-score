Ever wondered how to assess if the text is hard or easy to read? For a human, this task is pretty simple: you just read the 
text and feel if you're struggling or not. But how to teach a computer do that? In this project, you will write such a program.

Firstly, let's create a simple program. If a text contains more than 100 symbols (including spaces and punctuation), then it 
is considered hard to read. Otherwise, the text is considered easy to read. If a text contains exactly 100 symbols, it is still 
easy to read.

The input contains a single line of text. Output "HARD" if the text is hard to read and "EASY" if the text is easy to read.

Examples:

Example 1: the text that has less than 100 symbols.

> This text is easy to read!
EASY
Example 2: the text that has more than 100 symbols.

> This text is hard to read. It contains a lot of sentences as well as a lot of words in each sentence.
HARD
Example 3: the text has lots of spaces and 104 symbols, making it hard to read.

> # T h i s  t e x t  h a s  a  l o t  o f  s p a c e s  a n d  p u n c t u a t i o n  m a r k s ! ! ! ! !
HARD
Example 4: the text has lots of spaces and only 93 symbols, making it easy to read.

> T h i s  t e x t  h a s  a  l o t  o f  s p a c e s  t o o  b u t  i s  e a s y  t o  r e a d
